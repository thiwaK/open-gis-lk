## Overview
[**OpenGIS LK**](https://thiwak.github.io/open-gis-lk) is an **open-source web application** that brings **Sri Lanka’s spatial data** 🗺️ into one easily accessible place. Many geospatial datasets about Sri Lanka are scattered across different sources - OpenGIS LK collects them, so anyone can find, select, and download the data they need for any area of interest.

The goal of OpenGIS LK is to make Sri Lanka’s spatial data more discoverable, usable, and freely available to researchers, planners, developers, students, and the public — supporting better research, planning, and decision-making.
